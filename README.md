To run and test the solution follow these steps:

1. Open your preferred web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox).

2. Navigate to the GitHub website (https://github.com/kamlesh0007/Drag-Drop-) 

3. Look for a button that says "Code" or "Clone" and click on it. This will display a dropdown menu with options for cloning the repository.

4. Click on the "Download ZIP" option in the dropdown menu. This will download a ZIP file containing the repository's code to your computer.

5. Locate the downloaded ZIP file on your computer and extract its contents. This will create a folder with the repository's name, containing the code files.

6. Open the extracted folder and locate the HTML file (e.g., `index.html`) that corresponds to solution.

7. Double-click on the HTML file to open it in your web browser. This will run the HTML file and display the web page.

8. Interact with the web page to test the functionality of my solution. Drag and drop items between containers, click the reset button, and verify that the expected behavior is observed.

9. Use the browser's developer tools (usually accessible by right-clicking on the web page and selecting "Inspect" or similar options) to view the console for any error messages or logs that may help in troubleshooting or debugging.

10.By following these steps, you should be able to run and test my solution directly from the GitHub code repository using a web browser.
